Highschool Intro to CS Final Project

This is a tetris clone written in Tkinter for my high school Intro to CS course
There are some serious graphics rendering problems, so on some screens there is a bad flickering effect

How to play:
Clone the repository and then run `python game.py` through the command line 
Will NOT run through IDLE
