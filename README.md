Highschool Intro to CS Final Project

This is a tetris clone written in Tkinter for my high school Intro to CS course. There are some serious graphics rendering problems, so on some screens there is a bad flickering effect

How to play:

Clone the repository and then run `python game.py` through the command line. Will NOT run through IDLE
